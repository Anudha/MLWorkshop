## LESSON 4 Goals ##

TRAIN A PYTORCH MODEL FROM SCRATCH.  

Modify hyperparameters and record training time on a particular hardware config and accuracy.  
Contribute thoughts on how an individual real-estate agent can use this data & how a company like zillow or air-bnb can use this data.  

''' # AM

This notebook illustrates the following commonly used steps in data science, machine learning, deep learning:

- Load real estate data into a pandas dataframe
- load a subset of the data 
- get basic statistics on data
- drop columns that you are not using as features in your prediction model
- switch between numpy arrays and pytorch tensors (datatypes)
- Train a model with and without rescaling data and calculate effect on root MSE
- compare R^2 and MSE loss as conceptually meaningful

- Train a small pytorch model to determine the market price of a house
