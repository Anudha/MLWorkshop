**Values**
- support skills that are in alignment with industry job requirements
- support research and intellectual skills
- support gender balance in tech community



**Dev Environment**
- setting up local dev environments (VS code, pip install, or another package manager, make a virtual environment)
- work on a remote machine (ssh, scp, linux commands)
- trouble shoot errors (sometimes this is intimidating and people give up)

**Using Open Source Models**
- From Ultralytics
- From HuggingFace

**ScikitLearn**
- Train Your First Model

**PyTorch**
- Train a model
- Work with audio datasets
- Work with image datasets
- Work with text datasets

**Distributions**
- normal
- binomial
- poisson
- uniform
- exponential

**Loss Functions**
- MSE
- Negative Sampling

**Demo your Model** 
- Each attendee will talk through their dataset, their analysis, and/or the model they trained.  
- This achieves our value in technical communication.
