# workshop lesson 2

first Wednesday, 60 minutes

# high level intro

We accomplish more together than we do alone.
Software engineering is a team sport.

# project plans

Each team will describe

- their chosen business problem
- the input dataset
- desired result
- how they will validate / measure success
- skills focus of each team member
- two things they're worried might go wrong (e.g. trouble with data cleaning)
- backup plan if something doesn't pan out as expected

# synthesis

What are the commonalities among the projects?
Hopefully we can find a data modality or a modeling technique
that is shared by at least two projects.

Let's assume it splits into two groups at this point: text versus image.
Treat both at a high level, then pick one and dive deeper,
reserving the other one for tomorrow.
