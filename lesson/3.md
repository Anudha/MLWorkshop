# workshop lesson 3

first Thursday, 60 minutes

# daily standup

Per team, and per person, ask for a brief report:

- Since our last session I did _that_,
- I plan to do _this_,
- I have (no) roadblocks.

# deep dive

[Assume that in the last lesson we found projects split into two groups: text versus image.]

Delve into image theory and practice, given that we yesterday we did that for text.

# TBD

[fill in more material here]

# weekend instructions

[This will be the biggest opportunity for hack, hack, hack,
both individually and in teams. Encourage each team to
Zoom or meet in person over the weekend. We will need a
draft slide deck by Tuesday. Committed in GitHub.]

# exeunt
